    <h1 id="title">School Games — Official Notice & Terms</h1>
    <p class="small">Last updated: August 21, 2025</p>

    <div class="note">
      <strong>Important summary:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>https://gomega.watch/schoolgames</strong> was originally intended to host casual school games, but it is <strong>no longer active</strong> and will not be restored.</li>
        <li>The <strong>School Games</strong> page will <strong>never be up again</strong> in its prior form.</li>
        <li>These terms are a formal notice and will be added to our official site when we have time to publish them site-wide.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The School Games area was an experimental section intended for casual gaming in safe, supervised environments. Over time we determined that hosting that content publicly created misuse and conflicts with school policies. For this reason, the section has been retired and will not be re-launched.</p>

    <h2>Message to Students & Users</h2>
    <p>This service is not intended to help students bypass school network rules, classroom management, or filtering. If you are a student or a user within a school environment, you should follow your institution's acceptable use policies. We are not responsible for any disciplinary or other consequences that result from using Gomega contrary to your school’s rules.</p>

    <div class="warning">
      <strong>Discipline & Enforcement:</strong> Accounts that misuse the Service, break our Terms of Service, or disrupt other users may be suspended or terminated at our discretion. We reserve the right to ban accounts for cause or for no reason, consistent with our Terms.
    </div>

    <h2>Message to School Administrators</h2>
    <div class="admin">
      <p>We take legitimate administrative concerns seriously. If your school has detected students using our Service in violation of school policy, we are willing to cooperate to the extent possible and lawful.</p>
      <p>To help, we can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Review available logs and account activity associated with your report.</li>
        <li>Provide account-related information or take action against accounts when presented with a valid, documented request or lawful process.</li>
        <li>Discuss technical or administrative steps schools can use to limit access (e.g., network-level blocking, using device management tools, or contacting us for assistance).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>How to contact us:</strong> Send a detailed request to <a href="mailto:support@gomega.watch">support@gomega.watch</a> including timestamps, IP addresses (if available), usernames, and any relevant screenshots. We will respond and cooperate consistent with applicable law and our privacy obligations.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Legal & Liability</h2>
    <p>By using our service (including any archived or related pages), you agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. We provide our services "as is" and do not accept responsibility for improper or unauthorized use by third parties. We encourage institutions to use established network controls and device management tools to prevent unwanted access.</p>

    <h2>Publication Note</h2>
    <p>These terms will be placed on the official website when operational priorities allow. This page serves as the current official notice about the status and policies around the former School Games section.</p>

    <h2>Contact & Requests</h2>
    <p>General questions, reports, and administrator requests should be sent to <a href="mailto:support@gomega.watch">support@gomega.watch</a>. For urgent or legal requests, include the word <strong>URGENT</strong> in the subject and provide as much detail as possible.</p>
